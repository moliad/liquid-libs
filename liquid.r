	history: {
		v0.0.1 - 0.5.0
			-several years of prototyping different dataflow systems.
			-eventually combined into one codebase
			-eventually merged into A SINGLE base class (out from 4 different & incompatible base classes)
			-adding of caching, low-level linking, propagation, processing levels.
			-cycle detection algorythm testing
			-several stub functions now officially part of api.
		
		v0.5.1
			-finalise new piping and mud mechanism
			
		v0.5.2
			-link()/exlusive implementation
	
		v0.5.3
			-add /as to liquify
			
		v0.5.4
			-add stats method to valve.
			-fully test and enable labeled mode for linking
			-add valve/links/labels
			-add valve/links/labeled
			-finish block optimisation in instigate returning all subordinate values directly.
			
		v0.5.5 - 24-Apr-2006/13:13:13
			-added disregard
			-rebuilt unlink using disregard (cause v0.5.4 didn't unlink observers! MAJOR BUG)
			-link() should return an error when trying to link a pipe server using /label (not likely, but for advanced users this must be explicitely disallowed)
			-support multiple plugs per label
	
		v0.5.6 - 26-Apr-2006/11:14:34
			-added /fill refinement to liquify
	
		v0.5.7 - 27-Apr-2006/3:35:39
			-removed all double comments (;;) from code
			-improved comments on valve/setup and explicitely state that we can call link at that point.
			-added valve/sub()
			-cycle? now officially part of miscelaneous methods
			-added /link refinement to liquify
	
	
		v0.5.8 - 29-Apr-2006/14:31:40
			-verbose is now off by default, from now on.
	
	
		v0.5.9 - 29-Apr-2006/15:02:55
			-fix dirty? state return valur of purify.
			-fixed propagate as a result of above fix
	
	
		v0.5.10 - 24-May-2006/17:07:43
			-added category to valve.  helps in classification.
			-removed init as default startup state, easy to forget and invalidates dirtyness by default..
			 better let the user toggle it on knowingly  :-)
	
		v0.5.11 - 5-Oct-2006/2:27:14
			-renamed plug! to !plug (no clash with real types)
			-officially added !node alias to !plug (to ease adoption)
			-liquify/link properly support single plug! spec (it used to support only a block of plugs)
			-added linked-container? attribute to !plug
			-fill now creates a container (simple pipe) rather than a pipe (linked pipe) by default.
			-added word! clash protection on link labels, so that instigate code can separate labels from actual word! type data (not 100% fault tolerant, but with documentation, it becomes easy to prevent).
	
		v0.5.12 - 17-Oct-2006/11:58:09
			-license switch to MIT
	
		v0.5.13 - 20-Oct-2006/5:31:44

		v0.6.6 - 13-Apr-2007/19:02:58 (MOA)

		v0.6.17 - 16-Jul-2007/22:57:02 (MOA)
	
		v0.7.0 - 7-Mar-2009/00:54:04(MOA)
			-added PIPE-SERVER-CLASS functionality to ease custom pipe management
			-fixed minor fill bug related to binding in rebol sub-objects
			
		v0.7.1 - 8-Mar-2009/05:54:04(MOA)
			-fixed regression in link() where a word was deleted from the code for some unknown reason, breaking the function on un-piped nodes.
			-added FROZEN? and related functionality. can be set to a function for powerfull dynamic node freezing.
			
		v0.7.2 - 8-Mar-2009/21:25:55(MOA)
			-officially deprecated and REMOVED SHARED-STATES from the whole module
			-ON-LINK() 
		
		v0.8.0 - 15-Mar-2009/00:00:00(MOA)
			-adding stream engine for propagation-style inter-node messaging.
			-STREAM() added for look-ahead messaging (ask observers to react to us)
			-ON-STREAM() added to support callbacks when a stream message arrives at a plug.
			
		v0.8.1 - 28-Mar-2009/00:00:00(MOA)
			-PROPAGATE?() added to valve - allows us to optimise lazyness in some advanced plugs
			-LINK?() regression found and fixed... cycle?() was not being used anymore!
			
		v0.8.2 - 02/04/2009/11:13PM(MOA)
			-the index? of returned instigate() block is now OFFICIALLY the insert position of the linked-container, if any.
			 this used to be an undefined aspect of liquid, but must now be explicitely handled in any
			 custom cleanup function.  This was added, since some plugs will need this at the head, while others
			 will need it at the tail, for processing consistency.
			 
		v0.8.3 - 04/04/2009/3:10AM (MOA)
			-fixed bug in CLEANUP() which didn't use path to access the instigate method.
			-fixed CYCLE?() bug which tripped over labeled links.
			-added optional PLUG/PREVIOUS-MUD attribute handling to fill, allows other funcs to detect if fill actually
			 changed value.
			-PLUG/PREVIOUS-MUD now set within CLEANUP(), so that multiple fills do not trigger events, until they have been used.
			-LINKED?() little improvements.
			
		v0.8.4 - 27/04/2009/10:37PM (MOA)
			-plug/mud is now an official store of pre-allocated series, which you do not want to reset (re-allocate) at each process()
			 no code change, but now an official specification.  so plug/mud is not changed by any function except fill() and related.
			 
		v0.8.5 - 03/05/2009/8:15AM (MOA)
			-added UNLINK() stub function
			
		v0.8.6 - 15/09/2009 6:27PM (MOA)
			-fixed ATTACH() regression which didn't set pipe? on pipe clients ... strange
			-added 'LIQUID-ERROR-ON-CYCLE? attribute to lib.  this tells liquid to raise an error if 
			 the LINK?() method detects a cycle?(). prevents unlinked plugs from being silently ignored
			 and causing frustrating errors (and hard to understand/debug).
			-Liquid now sets 'LIQUID-ERROR-ON-CYCLE? to true by default, so connection errors will result
			 in thrown errors... beware.
		
		v1.0.0 01/10/2010 (MOA)
			-removed ALL vprint-based debugging to dramatically increase performance. (only !plug/valve/stats remains with vprint).
			-as I am using this library in a publicly-released application for the first time, and because I've
			 been actively using liquid successfully in most projects for YEARS, I've decided to sign-off 
			 on an official reference v1 release.
			 
		v1.0.1 17/04/2010 (MOA)
			-optimised propagate so its ignored when a node is already dirty.
			-fixed cycle? so it starts at observer, instead of subordinate... fixes erronous cycle detections.
		
		v1.0.2 27/04/2010 (MOA)
			-bridge pipe server mode work started.
			-completely rebuilt attach and link functions.  they are faster and add bridge.
			-replace linked-container? by resolve-links? attribute. any pipe or container can now process as well as store.
			-fixed little shortcomings in destroy() and linked?()
			-half of the library is rewritten with optimisation for speed and bridge support throughout.
			-empiric unit-testing shows that changes have had a VERY positive effect on various aspects of liquid (alloc, process,etc).
			-added support for CHECK-CYCLE-ON-LINK?.  this is EXTREMELY advanced control of liquid, but makes an as extreme difference on allocation.
			 use it within controled systems which can clearly and properly manage the linkeage.  when building user guis or readable scripts,
			 make sure to use cycle? before linking, if cycle-check is off.
			-unit-testing & profiling
	
		v1.0.3 30/04/2010 (MOA)
			-bridge support testing and fixing.
			
		v1.0.4 12/05/2010 (MOA)
			-CHECK-CYCLE-ON-LINK? is now OFF BY DEFAULT
			-bridge mode finished
			-bug fixes in CLEANUP()
			-added /TO refinement to ATTACH() stub
			-added REINDEX-PLUG()
			-added FREEZE() and THAW() stubs
			
		v1.0.5 2010-06-23 (MOA)
			-added PROCESS()  stub
			-added BRIDGE() stub
			-added PLUG?() to determine if something is a liquid plug
			-added NOTIFY() valve method and stub
			-added /ONLY to valve/DETACH() and stub
			-added /PRESERVE to ATTACH() stub
			-removed most vprinting to accelerate library
		
		v1.1.0 2012-02-07 (MOA)
			-added concept of !default-plug.
			
		v1.1.1 2012-09-12 (MOA)
			-re-instated a few vprints
			-fixed PLUG/VALVE/FILL() when used on pipe clients... they don't get propagated back (it never gets dirty).
			
		v1.2.0	2012-11-07 (MOA)
			-Added FORMULATE()
			-Tweaked PROCESSOR(), which now uses FORMULATE()
			-Started to add unit tests using SLUT library.
			
		v1.2.1  2012-11-14 (MOA)
			-we can now control HOW link resolving is merged with the plug's mud (pipe or container).  See resolve-links? documentation for more details.
		
		v1.3.0 - 2013-06-20
			-added LINKED-MUD mode to resolve-links?, only usable by pipe-master, doesn't cause processing.
			-changed license to Apache v2
		
		v1.3.1 - 2013-10-11
			- 'PIPE() in external API now fills plug with value
			- 'PLUG?() now returns the plug itself instead of true
			- added new API method: PIPE? to detect if a plug is already a pipe server.
	
		v1.3.2 - 2013-10-17
			-MAJOR FIX to Pipe handling on Attach.  The pipe server now uses its own value as initial mud, 
			so that any cleanup receives the current value.  When a new pipe server is built, it uses the source's
			value for itself.
			
		v1.3.3 - 2013-10-21
			- PROCESS() api function is now officially deprecated, and renamed --process()
	
		v1.3.4 - 2013-10-30
			- added 'LIQUID? and 'MODEL? to differentiate between plug classes (models) and plug instances (liquids)
			- 'PIPED? now uses 'LIQUID? internally
			- 'PLUG? now accepts unset! inputs
			- Added tests for new 'LIQUID? and 'MODEL?  functionality

		v1.3.5 - 2013-11-15
			- valve/detach() now only cause a dirty if the plug was actually unpiped (from a pipe server or container mode.).
	
		v1.4.0 - 2015-06-03
			-added recipient push mechanism. Does not detect cycles, use at own risk.
			
		v1.4.1 - 2015-06-15
			-added fill/HOLD mechanism which allows pipe clients to temporarily ignore pipe server.
			-attach stub, now returns the attaching plug

	documentation: {
		Liquid is a very low-level library which implements dataflow driven programming in REBOL.
		
		It supports advanced features like lazyness and on-the-fly mutation.
		
		The basic !plug implements the complete reference design and will actually allow you to
		switch computation methods on the fly.  This means that the same plug implements dependency
		bridging, containment, hold and modify, and data sharing.
		
		The online docs are where you should go to get all the details about using and 
		customizing liquid plugs.
		
		note that as of version 1.3.4, plugs are classified as either liquids (instanciated plugs) or models (plug classes)
		we still use plug in general, but when a distinction is required, those are the names we should use.
	}
	;-  \ documentation
	to-do: {
		-----------------
		NOTE -  to do list is rarely up to date,
		-----------------
		-add more return values to functions like link, fill and connect, to allow interactive reactions to failed operations...
		-make ALL func tails (returns) GC friendly
		-once piped, a plug should not propagate dirty states, unless its pipe is dirty.  It should ignore any dirty
		 calls comming from its (temporarily useless) subordinates.
		-support label being present in subordinate list more than once (complements exclusive wrt labeled linking mode)
		-when attaching two piped plugs, add a callback to allow a pipe server to de-allocate itself safely when it 
		 detects it has no more pipe clients.
		
		** v2 proposals **
		-PUSH-MODE PROPAGATION OF PARAMETERS to all observers.
		 doesn't actually start processing, but distributes a set of values within a graph.
		-PROPAGATE ANY STATE, not just dirty. (ex: error), a subset of above
		-PARAMETER & CONTAINER INDEXED CACHING, caching of liquid is based on a key set of parameters, allowing us to
		 reload past processing!
		-CLASS-WIDE LINKS! all instances share links (allows VERY fast manipulation of global state without needing to 
		 link each instance separatly)
		-SUBORDINATE CONTAINMENT (like a fill, directly stored in subordinate block.)  allows us to simulate
		 a node which is connected to several subordinate containers, without the need to actually allocate any of them.

		;-       dirty?:
		;-----------------------------------------
		; has any item above me in the chain changed?
		; some systems will always set this back to false,
		; when they process at each change instead of deffering eval.
		;
		; v0.8.0 added the 'clogged state.  this is 
		;        defined as a dirty state within the
		;        node, but prevents any propagation
		;        from crossing the !plug, allowing
		;        for single refresh which doesn't
		;        cause the whole tree to become dirty.
		;
		;        usefull in controled environments
		;        especially to contain stainless?
		;        plugs to over reach observers which
		;        actually do not need to now about
		;        our own local refreshes.
		;
		; when plugs are new, they are obviously dirty.
		dirty?: True
		
		
		;-----------------------------------------
		;-       frozen?:
		;-----------------------------------------
		; this allows you to prevent a !plug from
		; cleaning itself.  the plug remains dirty
		; will never be processed.
		;
		; this is a very powerfull optimisation in many
		; circumstances.  We often know within a manager,
		; that a specific network has to be built before
		; it has any meaning (several links are needed,
		; data has to be piped, but isn't available yet, etc)
		; normaly, if any observer is stainless? or being
		; viewed dynamically, it will cause a chain reaction
		; which is ultimately useless and potentially slow.
		;
		; imagine a graphic operation which takes a second
		; to complete for each image linked... if you link
		; 5 images, you end up with a fibonacci curve of wasted time
		; thus 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 ... 13 operations, when only the last
		;  5 are really usefull!
		; as the data set grows, this is exponentially slow.
		;
		; if we freeze the node while the linking occurs,
		; and then unfreeze it, only one process is called,
		; with the 5 links.
		;
		; you could also use a function and let it react based
		; on conditions.
		;
		; nodes aren't frozen by default cause it would be tedious
		; to manage all the time, but use this when its 
		; worth it!
		frozen?: False
		
		
		;-----------------------------------------
		;-       stainless?:
		;-----------------------------------------
		; This forces the container to automatically regenerate content when set to dirty!
		; thus it can never be dirty...
		;
		; used sparingly this is very powerfull, cause it allows the end of a procedural
		; tree to be made "live".  its automatically refreshed, without your intervention :-)

		;-       pipe?:
		;-----------------------------------------
		;
		; pipe? is used to either determine if this liquid IS a pipe or if it is connected to one.
		;
		; v0.5.1 change: now support 'simple  as an alternative plug mode, which allows us to fill data
		; in a plug without actually generating/handling a pipe connection.  The value is simply dumped
		; in plug/liquid and purify may adapt it as usual
		;
		; This new behaviour is called containing, and like piping, allows liquids to store data
		; values instead of only depending on external inputs.
		;
		; This property will also change how various functions react, so be sure not to play around
		; with this, unless you are sure of what you are doing.
		;
		; by setting pipe? to True, you will tell liquid that this IS a pipe plug.  This means that the plug
		; is responsible for notifying all the subordinates that its value has changed.
		; it uses standard liquid procedures to alert piped plugs that its dirty, and whatnot.
		;
		; By setting this to a plug object, you are telling liquid that you are CONNECTED to a 
		; pipe, thus, our fill method will send the data to IT.
		;
		; note that you can call fill directly on a pipe, in which case it will fill its pipe clients
		; normally.
		;
		; also, because the pipe IS a plug, you can theoretically link it to another plug, but this 
		; creates issues which are not designed yet, so this useage is not encouraged, further 
		; versions might specifically handle this situation by design.

		;-       shared-states:
		;
		; deprecated (unused and slows down operation)
		;-----------------------------------------
		; this is a very special block, which must NOT be replaced arbitrarily.
		; basically, it allows ALL nodes in a liquid session to extremely 
		; efficiently share states.
		;
		; typical use is to prevent processing in specific network states
		; where we know processing is useless, like on network init.
		;
		; add  'init to the shared-states block to prevent propagation whenever you are
		; creating massive amounts of nodes. then remove the init and call cleanup on any leaf nodes
		;
		; the instigate func and clear func still work.  they are just
		; not called in some circumstances.

		;
		; This is a paired list of destination and process func which allows you to send your 
		; data in another format to another plug.  
		;
		; Note that only a direct call to plug/valve/FILL() will use this list of targets.
		; 
		; Receiving notifications from a pipe server will NOT cause any circulation.
		;
		; This allows you to convert data and send it to other plugs, but remember that
		; this is a push mechanism, so any processing done here is done EVERY time you use 
		; fill on the function.
		;
		; also note that the push is done AFTER the local fill is done, so any stainless

		;-       holding?:
		;
		; allows fill/hold to stick until the pipe causes propagation.
		;
		; when a plug is in hold mode, it doesn't send its mud to the pipe server,
		; it temporarily stays independent.  this allows for a kind of in progress
		; status which doesn't interact with the pipe, until it is ready, at which
		; point you just use a normal fill and the hold mode is reset.
		;
		; you can also do a fill/reset, which will clear the hold mode and set the plug client,

			;----------------------
			;-        stream()
			;----------------------
			; v0.8.0 new feature.
			; this allows a node to broadcast a message just like propagation, but
			; instead of handling container dirtyness, an acutal message packet is 
			; sent from node to node depth first, in order of observer links
			;
			; any node down the chain can inspect the message and decide if he wants 
			; to handle it.  in such a case, he will decide if the handling may
			; interest children or not. he may mutate the message, or add a return element
			; to it, and simply return. any node which detects the return element in the
			; message must simply stop propagating the message, cause it has been detected
			; and is a single point reply (only one node should reply).
			;
			; in the case where the stream is meant as an accumulator, the return message 
			; may simply include a new element which starts by 'return- (ex: 'return-size)
			; this will not provoke an arbitrary propagation end.
			;
			; it is good style (and actually suggested) that you use the plug's type name
			; within the message element and accumulator-type return values because 
			; it ensures the element names does not conflict with other plug authors msg.
			;
			; the stream message format is as follows.
			;
			; [ ; overall container
			;     'plugtype [plug/sid 'tag1: value1 'tag2: value2 ... 'tagN: valueN ] ; first message packet
			;     'plugtype [plug/sid 'tag1: value1 'tag2: value2 ... 'tagN: valueN ] ; second  message packet
			;     'plugtype [plug/sid 'tag1: value1 'tag2: value2 ... 'tagN: valueN ] ; third  message packet
			;     ...
			;     'return [return-plug/sid 'tag1: value1 'tag2: value2 ... 'tagN: valueN ]  ; return message (only one)
			; ]
			;
			; using the sid instead of a plug pointer limits the probability of memory sticking 
			; within the GC, uses less ram, and is MUCH more practical cause you can print the message.

			;
			; eventually, purify will propagate the stale status to all dependent plugs if it is not
			; able to recover from an error, like an unfiltered node or erronous piped value for this plug.
			;
			; Note that the stale state can be generated within purify if its not happy with the current value
